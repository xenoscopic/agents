# Agent Directives

This repository contains an `AGENTS.md` file designed to match my natural coding
style. Running the `install.sh` script will register this `AGENTS.md` file with
Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and opencode. The script uses symbolic links to allow
for dynamic updates and will ask before overwriting any existing files.
